# Section 1.2.1: Bezout's identity

In Section 1.2.1, Knuth introduces induction.

He also states, proves and implements [Bezout's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#Bézout's_identity) which he calls the "Extended Euclud's algorithm":

Given two positive integers, m, n, we compute the common greates divisor, d, and also integers a, b (not needed to be positive) such that d = am + bn.

As wikipedia notes, this is the prototype of a primary ideal.

Knuth also calls this algorithm E, but I'll call it B:

Input: n, m

1. [ Initialize ] a' = b = 1, a = b' = 0, c = m, d = n
2. [ Divide ] q = c ÷ d; r = c % d (c = qd + r ie m = qn + r)
3. [ Remainder zero? ] r == 0 && return (d=n, a=1, b=q)
4. [ Recycle ] c = d, d = r, t = a', a' = a, a = t-qa, t = b' , b' = b, b = t - qb, goto 2.

This can be done a bit simpler, but we do need to remember a and b over 2 iterations:

1. [ Initialize ] a = b2 = 0, b = a2 = 1
2. [ Divide ] q = m ÷ n; r = m % n (m = qn + r)
4. [ Recycle ] (m, n, a, b, a2, b2) = (n, r, a2 - qa, b2 - qb, a, b)
3. [ Remainder zero? ] r == 0 && return (a, b, m)
4. goto 2
