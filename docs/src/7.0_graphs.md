# Chapter 7. Graphs

## Adjacency matrix

The adjacency matrix of a directed graph is defined on page 19 and used on page 20.

## SGB data structure

The SGB (Stanford GraphBase) datastructure for directed graphs is defined on page 21.

## Data structures and methods

I'll like to be able to convert between representations like adjaceny matrix, SGB form and other representations.

``` julia
struct AdjacencyMatrix
    A::Matrix{Int}
end
```

``` julia
struct SgbArc
    TIP::Int
    NEXT::Union{Missing,SbgArc}
end
struct SgbVertex
    NAME::String
    ARCS::SgbArc
end
struct SgbDigraph
    nodes::Vector{SgbVertex}
end
```

## TODO

* adjacency(x::SgbDigraph)
* sdbDigraph(x::AdjacencyMatrix)
* Algorith B (bipartate testing) p22 ff

Before the graphs there are some interesting claims about latin squares that could be nice to check.
